Geek is going for n day training program. He can perform any one of these three activities Running, Fighting, and Learning Practice. Each activity has some point on each day. As Geek wants to improve all his skills, he can't do the same activity on two consecutive days. Help Geek to maximize his merit points as you are given a 2D array of points points, corresponding to each day and activity.

Example:
Input:
n = 3
points = [[1,2,5],[3,1,1],[3,3,3]]
Output:
11
Explanation:
Geek will learn a new move and earn 5 point then on second
day he will do running and earn 3 point and on third day
he will do fighting and earn 3 points so, maximum point is 11.

approach :

Memoization  ( Top Down approach )

Time complexity : O(Nx4)x3
Space compelxity : O(Nx4) + O(N)

class Solution {
  public:
    int maxPoint(vector<vector<int>> &dp,vector<vector<int>>&points,int day,int last)
    {
        //base case
        if(day==0)
        {
            int maxi=0;
            for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
            {
                if(i!=last)
                {
                     maxi=max(maxi,points[0][i]);
                }
            }
            return dp[day][last]=maxi;
        }
        
        //whether this index is already computed( memoization )
        if(dp[day][last]!=-1) return dp[day][last];
        
        int maxi = 0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
        {
             if(i!=last)
             {
                 int point=points[day][i]+maxPoint(dp,points,day-1,i);
                 maxi=max(maxi,point);
             }
        }
        return dp[day][last]=maxi;
    }
    int maximumPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int n) {
          vector<vector<int>> dp (n,vector<int>(4,-1));
          return maxPoint(dp,points,n-1,3);
    }
};
